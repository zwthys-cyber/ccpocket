## Summary

<!-- What does this PR do? Keep it brief and describe the user-visible outcome. -->

## Why This Is A PR

<!--
For non-trivial changes, open a Prompt Request or Issue first.
Write "None — <reason>" only for a small, self-contained change.
Maintainer-authored PRs up to 50 files may instead document their scope decision here.

## Changes

<!-- List only changes needed for the primary goal. Omit unrelated refactors and speculative additions. -->

## Scope Check

<!-- One user-visible goal per PR. PRs over 150 changed files are closed. -->

- Single primary goal:
- Intentionally out of scope:
- Split plan or why this cannot be split:

## Test Evidence

<!--
Run the checks for each changed area before submitting:
https://github.com/zwthys-cyber/ccpocket/blob/main/docs/development-testing.md#before-opening-a-pr
Bridge changes need the full Bridge test suite, type check, and build; a targeted
test alone is not sufficient. Name any checks not run and explain why.
Include exact commands and actual results. Bug fixes need a regression test or
reproducible before/after validation when automation is impractical.
Write "N/A — <reason>" when validation does not apply.
For <=10-file low-risk PRs, supporting context and manual/platform fields are
advisory; UI and OS-dependent changes still require their relevant evidence.

- Automated tests (command and result):

## UI Evidence

<!--
Select exactly one option.
Text-only changes may use automated UI test evidence instead of an image. Include
a backticked `flutter test ...` command and its explicit successful result.
For visual or interaction changes, upload images directly to GitHub. An After
image or recording is required. Before may be "N/A — <reason>" only for a new UI.

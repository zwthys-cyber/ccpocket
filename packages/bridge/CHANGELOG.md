# Changelog

All notable changes to `@ccpocket/bridge` will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.88.0] - 2026-10-01

### Added
- Add opt-in Performance mode with per-client defaults and per-session overrides. Remove tool payloads, incidental screenshots, and thinking before WebSocket serialization while retaining generated images, attachments, approvals, plans, and lightweight activity updates.

### Changed
- Apply delivery filtering to live events, batched deltas, and restored histories without changing canonical agent history or other clients' delivery.
- Acknowledge delivery preference changes and mark intentional history sequence gaps so clients can safely switch modes, reconnect, and restore full history in standard mode.

## [1.87.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- Add opt-in, per-session Codex usage-limit recovery with reset-aware waiting, at most five automatic submissions per manual-input cycle, and cancellation and goal-budget guards.

### Changed
- Compress WebSocket traffic for supporting clients and use bounded tail reads for recent Codex session metadata while preserving paginated full history.

### Fixed
- Isolate recent Codex session discovery from active sessions so listing does not block behind an ongoing turn.
- Restore local session names and the latest continuation metadata, including legacy image lookup compatibility.

## [1.86.2] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- Preserve the Full Access permission profile when Codex sessions created or resumed in ccpocket are reopened in Desktop on Codex 0.157.0 or newer, while retaining legacy requests for older servers.

## [1.86.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- Keep failed background Codex goal lookups out of chat while preserving the last known goal and reporting manual lookup errors.
- Share concurrent Codex goal lookups and allow retry after failures.

## [1.86.0] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- Group Recent Sessions started in worktrees under their repository instead of showing each worktree as a separate project. Covers Claude Code worktrees (`<repo>/.claude/worktrees/<name>`), sibling git worktrees (resolved with git), and Codex sessions whose worktree was deleted (matched by the recorded repository URL). Resume still targets the worktree directory.

### Fixed
- Distinguish goal progress from goal completion in session and push notifications, avoiding premature completion alerts.
- Keep repository-filtered recent sessions independent of listing order, preserve monorepo subdirectory groups, and refresh cached repository information.

## [1.85.2] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed
- Prevent Bridge crashes when reopening large Codex sessions by loading history in small item pages and isolating oversized app-server responses to the affected connection.
- Bound large tool outputs, diffs, and inline images in the displayed history while preserving the original Codex history and conversation text. Retain compatibility with older history APIs.

## [1.85.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed
- Verify Finder locality through a short-lived loopback connection so sandboxed macOS apps can reveal files without external access to their protected container. Retain compatibility with legacy clients.

## [1.85.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- Reveal allowed project files in Finder using a short-lived, single-use local proof to prevent accidentally opening Finder on a remote Mac.

### Changed
- Improve large-media HTTP transfer throughput with bounded 256 KiB read buffers.
- Reduce large-text preview processing allocations while preserving exact line counts and truncation behavior.

## [1.84.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- Support optional file entries in directory listings while preserving directory-only responses for existing clients and enforcing allowed-directory and symlink restrictions.

## [1.83.1] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Update sharp to 0.35.4 for security fixes.

## [1.83.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Reuse temporary preview URLs for unchanged GLB files so clients can cache model downloads. Issue new URLs when file identity, size, or timestamps change.

### Changed
- Increase the GLB preview limit from 20 MiB to 50 MiB.
- Reject outdated model URLs after file changes while preserving path authorization checks.

## [1.82.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- Serve GLB model previews through a dedicated `read_model_file` request with project-scoped responses and temporary media URLs.
- Enforce a 20 MB model preview limit and reuse existing file path authorization and symlink protections.

## [1.81.5] - 2026-09-10

### Changed
- Replace deprecated Codex rollback calls with forks at the selected turn. Conversation rewind preserves the original thread and starts a fresh thread when rewinding before the first message.

### Fixed
- Fetch Codex history through paginated turn reads and avoid deprecated full-history hydration when resuming or forking threads. Preserve compatibility with older Codex servers and handle new threads with no persisted messages.
- Keep non-blocking Codex questions from pausing execution or reviving a completed turn, and prioritize blocking questions when approval is required.
- Prefer the current Codex service tier catalog, using legacy speed tiers only when the current field is absent.

## [1.81.4] - 2026-09-08

### Added
- Add opt-in file sharing outside the selected project with `BRIDGE_FILE_DOWNLOAD_ALLOW_ALL_PATHS=1`, persisted by launchd and systemd setup.

### Fixed
- Accept absolute file paths for downloads within the selected project while preserving default project and allowed-directory restrictions.

## [1.81.3] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- Fetch Codex usage limits from the App Server API so refresh retrieves current quota without running a conversation. Report fetch failures instead of displaying stale session-log values.

## [1.81.2] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed
- Normalize unsupported GPT-6 Astra `none` and `minimal` reasoning efforts to `low` when starting, resuming, or changing Codex models.

## [1.81.1] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- Preserve named Project and workspace identity across resumed sessions, prompt history, recordings, and workspace updates.

## [1.81.0] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- Add Bridge-managed named Projects with ordered multi-root workspaces, persistent CRUD, and session assignments for Claude and Codex.

### Changed
- Restore Project workspace roots when sessions resume and classify Recent Sessions by their explicit Project assignment.

## [1.80.2] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- Fail Codex resume attempts cleanly when another client owns the thread writer, without exposing or retaining a provisional session.

## [1.80.1] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed
- Keep Codex Fast mode synchronized across session indexing, resume, and runtime updates by normalizing current and legacy service-tier metadata.

## [1.80.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added
- Negotiate an explicit App–Bridge protocol range and reject incompatible clients before processing normal WebSocket messages.
- Publish the supported protocol range through session metadata and the version endpoint.

### Changed
- Pin persistent Bridge service setup to the stable `@ccpocket/bridge@1` major and have doctor detect and migrate legacy unbounded `@latest` configurations.

## [1.79.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Stream common audio and video formats for File Peek, including MP3, M4A, AAC, FLAC, Ogg, Opus, AIFF, MOV, WebM, MKV, M4V, AVI, and MPEG files.

### Fixed
- Restore persisted messages and runtime state when a session is opened from a notification.

## [1.78.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Include Git-ignored project files in Explorer listings with ignored-state metadata, while preserving tracked and untracked source files ahead of large ignored trees.
- Report modification times for duplicate file names so clients can prioritize the most recently changed match in file peek.

### Changed
- Exclude additional generated dependency and build directories from ignored-file discovery.

## [1.77.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added
- Add capability-negotiated request correlation metadata for project-scoped Git, file, worktree, screenshot, and session operations.

### Changed
- Return operation-specific, project-scoped failure responses so clients can route errors to the originating request.

### Fixed
- Prevent concurrent sessions and projects from receiving each other's asynchronous project responses.

## [1.76.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- Add secure, project-scoped file uploads with expiring capabilities, streamed HTTP transfers, SHA-256 integrity verification, conflict handling, cancellation, and configurable size and concurrency limits.

## [1.75.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- Add authenticated, project-scoped file downloads with expiring capability URLs, streaming and range support, cancellation, path and file-identity validation, and a configurable 512 MiB default size limit.

## [1.74.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- Support Claude Code sessions on Amazon Bedrock. When `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` is enabled in the Bridge environment or in the Claude Code user settings `env` block, non-OAuth Bedrock sessions can start and list models without an Anthropic API credential or the subscription opt-in. If Claude Code nevertheless initializes with OAuth, `BRIDGE_ALLOW_CLAUDE_OAUTH=1` is still required. AWS credentials stay on the Bridge host and are resolved through the normal AWS credential provider chain.

### Changed
- Report Amazon Bedrock in `doctor` as `Amazon Bedrock configured; AWS credentials not verified` instead of warning that Anthropic authentication is missing, warn when the required `AWS_REGION` is absent, and print each provider's authentication detail instead of a generic authenticated label.

## [1.73.1] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- Preserve process event order while generated media is registered so tool results remain before turn completion.

## [1.73.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added
- Add secure WAV and MP4 file delivery with scoped capability URLs and HTTP range request support for in-app media playback.

## [1.72.3] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed
- Keep Claude queued input FIFO and recover interrupted turns without duplicate delivery, while surfacing compaction and typed response failures cleanly.
- Classify Claude API-key and subscription authentication across delayed initialization without leaking estimated subscription cost or accepting subscription login without explicit opt-in.
- Correlate recent-session and scoped gallery requests across concurrent clients, retries, disconnects, and legacy responses.
- Bound archive requests with recoverable timeouts and ignore late RPC replies after retry.
- Keep internal Claude diagnostics, injected task notifications, and retryable Codex runtime warnings out of user transcripts.
- Derive automatic session titles from the user's actual text.

## [1.72.2] - 2026-08-25

### Changed
- Share one validation contract between new and resumed sessions to keep supported options consistent.

### Fixed
- Reject malformed optional session and permission values before they reach provider-specific process handling.

## [1.72.1] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed
- Refresh Codex approval, reviewer, and sandbox permissions from current Custom or profile configuration when resuming a thread, including granular policies and project-trust defaults.

### Added
- Allow clients to opt in to listing hidden directories while preserving allowed-root and symlink protections.

### Changed
- Correlate push registration requests and tool-action failures so clients can safely resolve asynchronous outcomes.
- Restrict push delivery to the Bridge's active token allowlist, including multi-device registration transitions.

### Fixed
- Prevent stale push registration completions from restoring disabled or superseded tokens.
- Release notification-link reconnect guards after clear-context session replacement, stopped sessions, and rejected tool actions.
- Keep approval transcript outcomes consistent across Claude and Codex tool results.

## [1.71.0] - 2026-08-22

### Added
- Add explicit `BRIDGE_ALLOW_CLAUDE_OAUTH=1` opt-in for using the Bridge machine's Claude subscription login, with authentication-source checks for sessions and model discovery.

### Changed
- Keep API-key authentication as the default and report a dedicated actionable error when subscription authentication has not been explicitly enabled.
- Persist the subscription opt-in in launchd and systemd service setup, and align doctor diagnostics and authentication guidance with the selected mode.

## [1.70.2] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- Skip stopped Codex processes for auxiliary RPCs so history, model, and recent-session requests can recover through a healthy or temporary app-server.

## [1.70.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- Ignore model-specific Codex rate limits when selecting account-wide usage, preventing the remaining quota from incorrectly appearing as 100%.

## [1.70.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- Add correlated `list_directory` and `directory_listing` WebSocket messages for browsing visible subdirectories within configured allowed roots.

### Fixed
- Authorize directory listings against canonical paths while preserving configured logical and symlink path namespaces in responses.

## [1.69.6] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- Use GPT-5.6 Luna with no reasoning effort for Codex auto-rename and commit-message assistance, reducing credit usage while preserving output quality.

- Reduce repeated history and image processing during session restore with reusable Codex history, content-addressed image references, and seven-day HTTP caching.

## [1.69.1] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Honor managed Codex auto-review restrictions when starting and resuming sessions, and expose the policy state to connected clients.
- Improve Codex app-server resilience around RPC errors, active-writer conflicts, archived threads, and streamed response recovery.

## [1.69.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- Emit structured Codex Guardian approval notices for medium- and high-risk auto-approved actions, with client capability negotiation and legacy history filtering.

## [1.68.2] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

## [1.68.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Reduce Codex skill-completion latency by reusing provider- and working-directory-scoped completion metadata and fetching skills, apps, and plugins in parallel with skills prioritized.

## [1.67.2] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed
- Run Codex commit-message and session-name assistance with no reasoning effort instead of inheriting a higher global setting.

## [1.67.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Suppress all approved Codex auto-review notifications regardless of reported risk while continuing to surface actionable warnings.

## [1.67.0] - 2026-07-16

### Changed
- Limit retained idle sessions to the 30 most recently active sessions so stale processes release background resources.

### Fixed
- Read Codex history through the process that owns the session instead of an unrelated active process.
- Suppress informational Codex auto-review approval notifications while continuing to surface actionable warnings.

## [1.66.2] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- Handle Codex tool suggestion dialogs and preserve their pending state until installation or authentication completes.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- Sandbox configuration now delegated to Claude Code native `.claude/settings.json` — Bridge passes only `enabled: true/false`
- Worktree configuration uses `.gtrconfig` only (removed `.ccpocket.toml` priority logic)

### Removed
- `.ccpocket.toml` support and `smol-toml` dependency — sandbox settings should be configured via `.claude/settings.json`

## [1.17.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Auto-enable `loginctl enable-linger` on systemd setup to keep the Bridge Server running after logout (SSH disconnect etc.)

- `checkSystemdService` in `doctor` command for Linux service health check
- Resolves full `npx` path at setup time so nvm/mise/volta-managed Node.js works under systemd

### Changed

- Unsupported platforms (e.g. Windows) get a clear error message

### Removed
- `claude auth login` feature removed (refactor: remove claude auth login feature)

## [1.15.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- Claude Code sandbox support — pass sandbox enabled/disabled state from mobile client to Claude SDK via `query()` options
- Claude sandbox mode toggle — changing sandbox restarts the session with the new setting (sandbox is a query-level config)
- `.ccpocket.toml` configuration file support with `[worktree]` section, prioritized over legacy `.gtrconfig`
- `smol-toml` dependency for TOML parsing

### Changed
- Simplified permission/sandbox mode forwarding — both Claude and Codex sessions now use unified message handling

## [1.14.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- Codex Skills (Prompts) support — fetch full skill metadata (description, defaultPrompt, brandColor) via `skills/list` RPC and forward to Flutter client as `skillMetadata`
- Send `SkillUserInput` (`{ type: "skill", name, path }`) when a Codex skill is selected, enabling proper skill loading and execution
- Handle `skills/changed` notification for automatic skill re-fetching
- Cache skill metadata alongside slash commands for session restore

## [1.13.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- Remove misleading WARNING log when BRIDGE_API_KEY is not set — API key authentication is optional (Tailscale handles security)

## [1.13.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Rewind session_created messages now include `sourceSessionId`, preventing duplicate session screens on restart and rewind
- Codex permission mode changes trigger a session restart (matching sandbox mode behavior) with confirmation dialog
- Codex session_created response now includes `permissionMode`, ensuring restored sessions retain their permission setting

## [1.13.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Claude OAuth authentication status endpoint — settings screen can display login state and trigger re-authentication without leaving the app (experimental)

### Fixed
- Usage API returning persistent 429 errors — refresh OAuth token on rate-limit responses (not just on 401), resolving stale-token rate limits
- Auth status check no longer probes the upstream API, eliminating redundant requests that could trigger rate limits when opening the settings screen

## [1.12.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- `errorCode` field on error messages for structured client-side display (`auth_login_required`, `auth_token_expired`, `auth_api_error`, `path_not_allowed`)

### Changed
- Auth and path-not-allowed error messages now include clear problem descriptions and remedy instructions (e.g. `claude auth login`) so users can self-resolve without checking server logs
- Dev script unsets `CLAUDECODE` env var to allow E2E testing inside a Claude Code session

## [1.11.1] - 2026-03-07

### Fixed
- Fall back to macOS Keychain for Claude OAuth credentials when `~/.claude/.credentials.json` does not exist (e.g. login performed on older Claude Code version that stored creds in Keychain)

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- Deliver available model lists (Claude / Codex) in `session_list` message so clients can display dynamic dropdowns instead of hardcoded values

### Changed
- Update model lists to latest versions: Claude 4.6 series (opus, sonnet, haiku), Codex gpt-5.4 default

## [1.10.1] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- Restore slash commands on `get_history` after history eviction — long sessions (100+ messages) lost `init`/`supported_commands` from in-memory history, causing slash completion to fall back to 4 built-in commands when re-entering the session
- Protect `system` messages from history eviction alongside `user_input`

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- `BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS` environment variable for project path whitelist (defaults to `$HOME`)
- Path validation on `start`, `resume_session`, `get_diff`, `get_diff_image`, `list_files`, `list_worktrees`, `remove_worktree` — rejects paths outside allowed directories
- Include `allowedDirs` in `session_list` message for client-side path input assistance
- Send `project_history` on WebSocket connect so clients receive history immediately

## [1.9.7] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Auto-refresh expired OAuth access token before starting SDK session (prevents auth errors when token expires between CLI sessions)

## [1.9.6] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Skip system-injected messages (`<local-command-caveat>`, `<local-command-stderr>`, etc.) when extracting firstPrompt/lastPrompt from JSONL scan
- Add streaming fallback for sessions with large user messages (embedded images) that exceed the 16KB head-read buffer
- Supplement missing lastPrompt for Claude sessions via tail-read with growing window (8KB→128KB), enabling distinct Last display mode in session list (+3-5ms overhead)

## [1.9.5] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Replace `claude auth status` process spawn with lightweight file read for auth pre-check (reduces memory pressure)
- Preserve extra credential fields (scopes, subscriptionType, rateLimitTier) when refreshing OAuth tokens

## [1.9.4] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Read Claude OAuth credentials from disk (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`) instead of macOS Keychain, eliminating iCloudHelper keychain dialog
- Replace keychain-based doctor check with file-based credential check

## [1.9.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- Pre-check Claude auth before starting SDK session to prevent macOS keychain access dialog
- Remove password read (-w flag) from doctor's keychain check to avoid triggering keychain dialog
- Preserve original user text when merging SDK echo (avoid overwriting with translated text)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Include Claude Code model name in session list response (stored from system/init message)

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Make Codex sandbox mode switching actually work (destroy + resume with new sandbox parameter)
- Fix 0-message session sandbox switch causing "no rollout found" error
- Always use last turn_context for codex session settings after sandbox mode changes
- Send sandbox mode in external format ("on"/"off") to clients instead of internal format

- Parallelize Claude + Codex session loading with Promise.all
- Remove messageCount from session index entries to eliminate full-file scanning

## [1.5.2] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Stabilize busy-path queue handling by deriving `input_ack.queued` and interrupt behavior from actual enqueue results
- Ensure busy-path logs are emitted consistently when input is queued and interrupted
- Resolve tool-result image paths relative to project root when CLI outputs project-relative absolute-like paths (e.g. `/images/...`)
- Fix gallery/image persistence failures caused by unresolved screenshot paths

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- Replace single-slot `pendingInput` with FIFO array queue to prevent message loss when multiple inputs arrive while the agent is busy
- Auto-interrupt the current agent turn when a new message is queued, so queued messages are picked up promptly instead of waiting for the turn to finish
- Add `queued` flag to `input_ack` response so the client can show a "queued" indicator
- Preserve queued messages across `interrupt()` calls instead of clearing them

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Server-side filtering for `list_recent_sessions`: `provider`, `namedOnly`, and `searchQuery` parameters
- Search matches against session name, first/last prompt, and summary

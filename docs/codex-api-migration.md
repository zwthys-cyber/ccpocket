# Codex app-server API migration (0.153.4)

## Full Access handoff to Desktop (0.157.0)

For explicit `fullAccess` sessions, Bridge sends
`permissions: ":danger-full-access"` on both `thread/start` and `thread/resume`
when the initialize response identifies stable Codex 0.157.0 or newer.
`approvalPolicy: "never"` and `approvalsReviewer: "user"` remain explicit.
The new field cannot be combined with `sandbox` or `sandboxPolicy`.

Legacy `sandbox: "danger-full-access"` produces no active permission profile.
An isolated 0.157.0 resume of a saved turn with that legacy setting restored
`sandbox_mode` from config while preserving `approval_policy: "never"`.
With a workspace-write config, Desktop consequently recognized Custom and
the effective sandbox changed. A saved
`active_permission_profile: {"id": ":danger-full-access"}` preserved Full
Access on resume. Auto Review already used workspace-write in this scenario.

Older, prerelease, and unidentified servers keep the legacy sandbox request:
older servers may silently ignore unknown request fields, so sending only
`permissions` without verified support could select an unintended sandbox.
0.157.0 is the verified compatibility floor, not a claim about the first
release introducing the API. Named config profiles, Custom, and other modes
keep their existing behavior. Existing rollouts are not rewritten; explicitly
resuming Full Access through an updated Bridge applies the profile to the
session, which subsequent turns can persist for Desktop handoff.

Validation includes start/resume request regression tests and isolated real
app-server checks with temporary session metadata, without model generation
or changes to production sessions.

## Previous API migration

Verified against the locally generated app-server TypeScript schema and
https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/app-server.

- Read history with `thread/read(includeTurns: false)` and ascending
  `thread/turns/list(itemsView: full)` pages. Only method-not-found falls back
  to legacy full-history reads for older Codex installations. New threads
  with no materialized history return an empty turn list.
- Resume with `excludeTurns: true`; session history is fetched separately.
- Fork with `lastTurnId` and `excludeTurns: true`, then read the fork through
  the paginated API. Verify its boundary before attaching a new session;
  older servers can silently ignore unknown fields.
- Conversation rewind creates a fork ending before the selected user message.
  Rewinding before the first user message starts a fresh thread. The original
  stored thread remains intact. No `thread/rollback` calls remain.
- Boundaries inside a turn containing multiple user messages (steering) are
  rejected: the fork API supports complete turns, not individual items.
- `serviceTiers` is authoritative, including an empty array. Read deprecated
  `additionalSpeedTiers` only when the current field is absent.
- `isBlocking: false` questions do not change execution to approval-waiting.
  They remain answerable after turn completion and during history restoration
  until explicitly answered or resolved. Session-context synchronization also
  preserves optional questions. Missing `isBlocking` retains the old
  blocking behavior.

Validation covers Bridge RPC routing/state tests, Flutter history restoration,
TypeScript/Dart analysis, and an isolated real app-server smoke test using a
synthetic two-turn rollout. The smoke test does not generate model responses
or modify production session history.

An iPhone 17 Pro simulator with a local mock Bridge verified restoration during
running, retention after result/idle, answer delivery, and dismissal on
`permission_resolved`. The test app and mock were stopped afterward.

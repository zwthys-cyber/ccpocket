metadata uploads succeeded. iOS is WAITING_FOR_REVIEW. Android production release

Google Play's metadata upload sent the approved four-language listing changes
for review before the binary submission. The Android workflow then stopped with
FAILED_PRECONDITION under ERROR_IF_IN_REVIEW. The Console was used to prepare
production release 1.127.2, containing only existing versionCode 244, the approved
four-language release notes, and 100% rollout. After automatic approval review
blocked adding it to the active listing review, the maintainer explicitly
authorized canceling and restarting that review with versionCode 244. During
the resumed operation the listing changes became approved. The Console then
accepted the release through its regular "Send changes for review" confirmation.
The final publishing overview shows production release 1.127.2 under changes in
review, all 20 listing changes ready to publish, and Managed publishing ON.
Do not rerun the promotion workflow: the Console submission is complete.

The public state and immutable ref were rechecked after approval and matched.
The four-language metadata, screenshots, and Google Play feature graphics were
uploaded from that ref. The iOS workflow submitted the existing build.
No new app binary, tag, IAP, or subscription is included.

iOS: KEEP preserved MANUAL, confirmed by asc validation. Review scope is
APP_VERSION_ONLY. Release requires a manual action after approval.
Android: 100% rollout is submitted. Managed publishing is ON, confirmed in the
Console and unchanged. Release requires a manual action after approval.

The iPhone captures also serve the Android listing by explicit maintainer
request. The app's orange accent is retained inside all genuine screenshots.
The audio player loaded its 12s sample during capture; playback progress did
not advance in the iOS simulator. No audio-player implementation was changed.

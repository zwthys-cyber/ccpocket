**Your agents. In your pocket.**

Codex and Claude, with a chat UI made for your phone. Start a task, approve the next
step, and review the result. Pick up the same work on your tablet or Mac.

## Install

1. Install at least one agent CLI on the machine that will run your sessions:
   [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) or [Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20.18.1 or newer on that same machine.
3. Clone this fork and build its Bridge Server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zwthys-cyber/ccpocket.git
cd ccpocket
npm ci
npm run bridge:build
node packages/bridge/dist/cli.js setup \
  --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765 \
  --api-key "$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
```

4. Install CC Pocket and scan the QR code printed by the Bridge Server.
5. Pick a project, choose Codex or Claude, and start coding from the app.

| Platform | Install |

| **Windows (experimental)** | Download the latest `.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/zwthys-cyber/ccpocket/releases?q=windows). Look for releases tagged `windows/v*`. |

## Free to Use

CC Pocket is free to use. If it helps your workflow, please consider becoming a Supporter in the app. Supporter purchases help cover development and AI tooling costs.

New to mobile coding agents? See [How to run Codex from iPhone or Android](https://zwthys-cyber.github.io/ccpocket/how-to-run-codex-from-iphone-android/).

## What You Can Do

- **Chat first.** Each session is a room for prompts, replies, approvals, and questions. Markdown, voice input, and image attachments make it easier to give direction on mobile.
- **Continue across devices.** Resume sessions from the CLI or app on your phone, tablet, or Mac. Larger screens show chat, files, and Git changes side by side.
- **Keep your place on weak networks.** Outgoing messages wait while you are offline and resend after reconnecting. Missed streaming updates are recovered. New agent requests need a connection.
- **Create and preview media.** Generate images with Codex Imagegen, open results in chat, and play video or audio files in the app.
- **Review and ship.** Browse files, inspect code and image diffs, stage changes, commit, push, or revert. Use git worktrees to separate parallel tasks.
- **Use your own machines.** Agents run on your Mac, Linux, or Windows host through the Bridge Server. Connect by QR code, saved host, or Tailscale; manage the Bridge over SSH.

## Why Fork CC Pocket?

CC Pocket is MIT licensed so you can treat it as a starting point for your own
agent workflow, not only as a finished app.

- Build an internal client that combines Codex or Claude with your team's Jira,
  Linear, GitHub, or private REST APIs.
- Remove surfaces you do not need and keep a focused app for your daily workflow.
- Reuse the Bridge sync layer, approval flow, prompt history, git operations,
  file browsing, and image/diff viewers instead of rebuilding them from scratch.
- Keep compatibility with the local agent tools and their session history while
  adding workflow-specific GUI features that are easier to use than prompts or MCP.
- Extend desktop support. macOS, Linux, and Windows builds are available today;
  Linux and Windows remain experimental because the project does not have the
  same continuous verification coverage for those environments.

For a deeper implementation overview, see the
[technical stack page](https://zwthys-cyber.github.io/ccpocket/architecture/) or the
[agent-readable Markdown](https://zwthys-cyber.github.io/ccpocket/architecture/stack.md).

## How It Works

CC Pocket has two parts:

```text
CC Pocket app  <->  Bridge Server on your machine  <->  Codex / Claude
```

The app is the interface you use. The Bridge Server runs locally on the machine that
has access to your projects, shell, git repository, and agent CLI. Your code stays
on your own machine instead of moving into a hosted IDE.

## Remote Access

On the same network, connect with the QR code, mDNS discovery, or a manual
`ws://` / `wss://` URL.

For access away from home or the office, Tailscale is the recommended setup:

1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) on your host machine and phone.
2. Join the same tailnet.
3. Connect to `ws://<host-tailscale-ip>:8765` from CC Pocket.

For an always-on host, the Bridge Server can also be registered as a background service:

```bash
node packages/bridge/dist/cli.js setup --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```

Service setup supports macOS launchd and Linux systemd.
For Bridge flags and persisted service settings such as `BRIDGE_ALLOWED_DIRS`,
see the [Bridge package README](packages/bridge/README.md#configuration).

## Notes

- Claude sessions use `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default. Subscription authentication
  requires explicit Bridge opt-in with `BRIDGE_ALLOW_CLAUDE_OAUTH=1` because
  Anthropic's current official guidance has an unclear scope for this architecture.
  See [Claude authentication troubleshooting](docs/auth-troubleshooting.md).
- CC Pocket is designed around self-hosting and minimal data collection. Supporter purchases
  restore within the same Apple ID or Google account, but do not sync across stores.
  See [Supporter / Purchases](docs/supporter.md).
- Screenshot capture on macOS requires Screen Recording permission for the terminal app
  running the Bridge Server.
- CC Pocket is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with Anthropic or OpenAI.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zwthys-cyber/ccpocket.git
